### **SLIDE 3: Why This Talk Matters**
**Visual:** Split screen - chaotic multi-tool setup vs clean Elixir progression
**Content:**
**Left Side - The Problem:**
- 🔧 Too many disparate tools
- 🔄 Context switching overhead
- 📚 Steep learning curves
- ⚡ Slow iteration cycles

**Right Side - The Elixir Way:**
- 🎯 Coherent ecosystem
- 🔄 Natural progression
- 📈 Gradual complexity
- ⚡ Fast feedback loops

**Speaker Notes (60 seconds):**
- "Why does this progression matter?"
- "In most ecosystems, you need completely different tools and mental models"
- "Prototype in Jupyter, script in Bash, build APIs in one language, front-end in another"
- "Each transition is painful - different syntax, paradigms, deployment strategies"
- "Elixir is different. The same principles apply from your first experiment to million-user applications"
- "The Actor model scales. Functional programming is consistent. OTP patterns work everywhere."
- "This isn't just theory - at Example Company, I've seen teams move from prototype to production using this exact progression"
